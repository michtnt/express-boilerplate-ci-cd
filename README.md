# Documentation

## Push

1. Commit new changes, trigger `Husky` to run test and `lint-staged` pre-commit
2. Commit successful, Trigger Github Actions on push to `master` branch, runs on `ubuntu-latest`
3. Run Lint (`ESlint` to find potential bugs, `Prettier` for code formatting)
4. Run Test (`Mocha` and `Chai`)
5. Deploy `Docker` image to `Heroku` (container has same stack [```ubuntu-latest```] with `Heroku` stack)
6. (Optional) Run `yarn test` on docker, not really needed since Github Actions CI environment is also ```ubuntu-latest```, same environment as Docker and Heroku
